# Flair

**Flair is a repository manager for collaborative, privacy-preserving machine learning.**  
Think of it as **Git + GitHub for ML models**, designed to work with federated learning.

Flair lets multiple contributors train a shared ML model **without sharing raw data**, while keeping a complete, verifiable history of every contribution.

---

## Why Flair?

Traditional collaboration platforms assume that:
- data can be centralized
- training happens in one place
- ownership of model contributions is unclear

Flair is built for situations where:
- data **must remain private**
- training happens **locally**
- multiple contributors improve the same model
- provenance, auditability, and ownership matter

Examples include research, sensitive datasets, regulated domains, and collaborative experimentation.

## Core Idea (No ML Background Required)

Instead of sending data to a server:

1. Each contributor **trains the model locally** on their own data  
2. Only the **model updates** (not the data) are shared  
3. Every update is treated as a **commit**, just like Git  
4. Commits can be reviewed, merged, reverted, and tracked over time  

Raw data **never leaves the contributor’s machine**.

## How Flair Works

### 1. Repositories for ML Models
- Create a repository for a machine learning model
- Push an initial (untrained or pre-trained) model
- Manage branches, permissions, and contributors

### 2. Local Training
- Contributors pull the latest model
- Training happens **entirely on their local system**
- Flair does not access or upload raw datasets

### 3. Commits, Not Uploads
- Each training result is a **commit**
- Commits include:
  - model parameter updates
  - metadata
  - optional metrics
- Commits are immutable and traceable

### 4. Asynchronous Aggregation
- Flair integrates with federated learning engines (e.g. Flower)
- Multiple contributors can train concurrently
- Updates are merged asynchronously using defined aggregation policies
- No locking, no “first commit wins” problem

### 5. Verifiable Training (Optional)
- Commits can include zero-knowledge proofs (zkML)
- Proofs verify that training followed agreed rules
- Verification happens asynchronously on the backend
- Proofs do **not** reveal training data

### 6. Ownership & Provenance
- Commits can be minted as NFTs
- Ownership of model contributions is cryptographically recorded
- Provenance is transparent and auditable

## What Flair Is NOT

Flair is **not**:
- a model deployment platform
- a clinical or diagnostic system
- a replacement for ML frameworks
- a data collection service

Flair is **infrastructure for building models**, not for making decisions.

## Architecture Overview

Local Client

├─ Trains model on private data

├─ Produces model update + metadata

└─ Pushes commit via Flair CLI

↓

Flair Backend

├─ Stores repo & commit metadata

├─ Triggers async aggregation

├─ Verifies zk proofs (optional)

└─ Records provenance

↓

Federated Learning Engine (e.g. Flower)

├─ Aggregates updates

├─ Handles staleness & concurrency

└─ Produces updated global model



---

## Supported Frameworks

- **PyTorch**

(Additional frameworks may be supported in the future.)

---

## Privacy Model

- Raw training data **never leaves the client**
- Only model updates are shared
- No dataset uploads
- No centralized data storage
- Optional cryptographic verification of training

Flair is designed so that **data cannot be extracted from the system**.

---

## Status

⚠️ **Early-stage / research-oriented project**

- APIs may change
- Not production-ready
- Intended for developers and researchers
- Feedback and contributions are welcome

---

## Open Source Philosophy

Flair is open source at the **client and protocol layer** to enable:
- transparency
- auditability
- ecosystem integration
- community contributions

Some hosted services and infrastructure components may remain closed-source.

---

## Disclaimer

Flair is intended for **research and development use only**.  
It does not provide medical advice, clinical decision support, or diagnostic functionality.

Any model built using Flair must be validated independently before real-world deployment.

---

## Contributing

Contributions, discussions, and design feedback are welcome.

Please note:
- Flair is infrastructure software
- correctness and clarity matter more than speed
- breaking changes may occur in early versions
